                <p>This is one of the first stories that I ever wrote. Its chaotic energy is present throughout the entire story and marks a great beginning for a great author. (Me.)</p>

                <p>This is the first full-length novel that I ever completed. And while it does suck some major butt, it proved to me that I could complete hard things. I plan on going back and revamping this, as I found my notes... they weren't half bad.</p>

                <p>This story was an expirment. I wrote it in the style of Dracula, in that it is a series of diary entires. This was much better written and is starting to show the potential that I truly have hidden away in the depths of my mind.</p>

                <p>Going back in time a bit, this cult classic kicked me off and settled me the Undertale Fandom as one of the greats. The humor, the excellent use of character, the way I mastered voice... those losers over at AO3 wish they could keep up with me.</p>

                <p>After leaning of the Hero's Journey, this is my attempt at following the structure to prove that any story could be made great if it followed it. However, I did the impossible... this story was total buns. Don't read it. Actually, read it as a bedtime story to your least favorite child.</p>

                <p>This is the crown jewel of all my workings. The story of a girl who changes her identity to be a man in order to escape an abusive household... written all within a couple months. I loved writing this book. And I'm sure you'll love reading it. :3</p>
